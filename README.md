# EmbeddedSys_Basic
A personal workspace for experimenting with low‑level embedded systems programming. This repository collects small, focused exercises that help refine skills in C, assembly, microcontroller configuration, and build tooling. It isn’t designed as a tutorial series — it’s a practical sandbox for trying ideas, testing workflows, and building familiarity with STM32 development.

## What’s inside
### 01_LedOn  
A minimal GPIO configuration example for turning on an LED using a button on the STM32 DISC1 board.

### 02_BlinkyLed  
A STM32 project demonstrating LED blinking with a structured way of accessing GPIO and RCC register.

### 02_LedButtonPress
Turning on an LED using a button on the STM32 DISC1 board using custom GPIO drivers.

## Tech stack
C and Assembly for embedded logic

CMake for build configuration

STM32 toolchain (GCC, OpenOCD, etc.)

Linker scripts for memory layout

## Purpose
This repo serves as a personal practice ground to:

Explore embedded concepts at your own pace

Test different project structures and toolchains

Build and refine workflows for STM32 development

Keep track of incremental progress through small, self‑contained exercises
